            <h1>Why did they become popular?</h1>
            <h3>Technology</h3>
            <p>The popularity of video games exploded due to the many technological

            <h3>Interactivity</h3>
            <p>Unlike TV or movies, games let players influence outcomes, creating
                a highly engaging and personalized experience that other media forms
                cannot easily recreate.</p>
            <h3>Cultural Shift</h3>
            <p>Gaming spread into homes and arcades, becoming a key part of pop culture

    <!-- Conclusion section -->
    <section>
        <div>
            <h1>Game Over (or is it?)</h1>
            <p>Video games have grown exponentially from their conception
                creating a very influential section of modern media. Who knows
                how they will evolve going forward and what other forms of media
                will converge to create new and unique experiences
            </p>
            <p>"Yet across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds
                as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects
                vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with
                envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans
                against us." â€” H. G. Wells (1898), The War of the Worlds</p>
